# Alfresco build sample using gradle

This project uses gradle instead of the Alfresco maven SDK.
It currently shows how to unit test Alfresco services e.g. in class link:src/test/java/xyz/its_me/alfresco/NodeServiceTest.java[NodeServiceTest].
The test expects a local mysql database with name alfresco, user alfresco, and password alfresco.
Please create a file src/test/resources/alfresco-global.properties if you need a different setup.
Please change the testRuntime dependencies in build.gradle in case you need another driver instead of mysql.
