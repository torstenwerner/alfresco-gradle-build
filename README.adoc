# Alfresco build sample using gradle

This project uses gradle instead of the Alfresco maven SDK.
It currently shows how to unit test Alfresco services e.g. in class NodeServiceTest.java.
The test expects a local mysql database with name alfresco, user alfresco, and password alfresco.
Please create a file src/test/resources/alfresco-global.properties if you need a different setup.
Please change the testRuntime dependencies in build.gradle in case you need another driver instead of mysql.
